- Password Length: The user will be asked to enter the desired length of the password. The password length must be between 8 and 128 characters.
- Include Uppercase Letters: The user will be asked if they want to include uppercase letters in the password.

- Include Numbers: The user will be asked if they want to include numbers in the password.
- Include Special Characters: The user will be asked if they want to include special characters in the password.
- Based on the user's preferences, a random password will be generated and displayed on the page. The user can then copy the password and use it for their desired purpose.
